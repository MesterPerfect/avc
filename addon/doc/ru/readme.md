# Audio Video Converter

* Author: Rainer Brell

## Functionality

The “Audio Video Converter” saves and converts a YouTube video or the multimedia link from a browser in MP3 or MP4 format.

If you are on a YouTube page in your browser, the YouTube video will be saved in the desired format without advertising. This also works if advertising is still playing at startup.

A 1 hour YouTube video can be saved as an MP3 in about 2 minutes. This depends on the performance of the computer.

This also works if you are currently playing a channel so that all videos in the channel are loaded. This can take a long time and take up a lot of space on the hard drive.

As soon as the convert command has been activated, the browser can be closed. The process continues in the background, which is signaled by sounds.

At the same time, a text file with a description is created for each YouTube video. You may find useful information there. The text file can be read with the Windows Editor. The creation of this file can be customized in the settings.

If you are not on YouTube, it will check whether you are on a link that points to a multimedia file. If this is the case, the destination will be saved accordingly and converted to the desired format.

During the conversion, a quiet beep will be emitted to let you know that the conversion is still in progress. This sound can be disabled in the settings.

The results are saved in their own folder, which you can access with a single hotkey. The folder can be customized in NVDA's settings.
